# PNPT-study-guide

## This is a sub repo of my [Obsidian Notes](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes) vault

I've expanded it into its own repo so it can be an accessible resource to others. This will house all of my notes/ study guides I generate while working through TCM Security's [PNPT Certification](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) and coursework.

### THIS REPO WILL NOT CONTAIN MATERIAL PRODUCED OR DISTRIBUTED BY TCM SECURITY

Instead, these will be my own notes which I create and use for my own learning and studying. If other outside references are used they will be linked appropriately.

#### I am not being paid by or taking part in any professional relationship with TCM Security

I'm doing this of my own volition. I would be taking these notes either way while going through this course and decided they are more valuable and useful if made available to others, similar to the [parent repo](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes).

## Thank you so much for stopping by and I hope this repo is useful for someone out there in the void!

P.S. Reference these notes at your own risk, I cannot verify their accuracy :)
