# Viewing, Creating, and Editing Linux Files:

## Appending & Editing:
To edit or append to a file in Linux, you can use `>` & `>>`. The single `>` will overwrite the file and replace any data that's in there with whatever you type/ place to the right of the `>`.

The `>>` will also edit the file but will **append** the contents to the right of it to the end of the file.
